I broke my self-imposed rule not to buy anymore stuff (again).  I don't need to buy any more books.  I have plenty of them currently that I need to finish.
But, after spending a good amount of time at Drama Bookstore, I decided that it was my civic obligation as a theater professional to buy something.  The only book that
called to me was one called "Writing Tools" by Roy Peter Clark.  So, I'm going to try to get into the habit of writing regularly.
